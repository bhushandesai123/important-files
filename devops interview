it adds layer on base layer

what is monitoring tool do? 

in grafana we can mesure cpu utilization,workload, storage actual answer of interview

if u manually change infra what happened to terraform sta file 
state file may corrupt

subnet

A subnet (short for subnetwork) is a smaller, segmented part of a larger network, like a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in cloud environments. It allows you to divide your network into more manageable sections.

Public vs. Private:
Improved Security private 


efficient routing :—-> 
Subnets in different regions help route user traffic to the closest server geographically
route 53 does it automatically we dont need to do anything


A Security Group (SG) in cloud environments like AWS is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to your resources (e.g., EC2 instances).

why sg is important 
Fine-grained Control: You can easily update the SGs if you need to change who can access your resources, without downtime.
What kind of traffic it is (protocols like HTTP, SSH, or database access).
Which port the request is trying to reach (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, port 22 for SSH).

what is the diffrent cost optimisation strategy u can use in industry

1. Right-Sizing Resources
2. Auto Scaling
3. Use of Reserved Instances or Savings Plans
6. Leverage Serverless Architecture
7. Optimize Storage
8. Monitor and Optimize Data Transfer Costs ontent delivery networks (CDNs) to cache content close to users and reduce long-distance data transfers, which can be costly
9. Use of Cost Monitoring Tools
10. Containerization

how much big ur infra 
10 services she says first infra was regular servers gradually moved to kubernetes
kube-proxy ensures communication betwen pod

 Services are used to expose Pods to external or internal traffic, allowing different parts of an application to communicate with each other reliable
clusterIp:——>
Creates a virtual IP (ClusterIP) to make the service accessible only within the Kubernetes cluster.
 backend needs to talk to a database service

/Nodeport 
Exposes the service on a static port on each node in the cluster. The service becomes accessible externally by hitting the node's IP and the NodePort.
Useful for small-scale testing or debugging, where you need to expose a service externally but without the complexity of a LoadBalancer.
eveloper testing an internal API locally that needs temporary external access for integration testing, without setting up a load balancer.

lb
to distribute traffic to the Pods and expose the service to the internet or external users.
A public-facing website or application where you need to distribute traffic to backend Pods across multiple nodes, such as an e-commerce platform or SaaS application.

4. ExternalName
Maps a service to an external DNS name, allowing services within the Kubernetes cluster to communicate with an external service by resolving the external DNS name
Used when integrating with external resources that aren’t hosted in the Kubernetes environment, such as cloud-based databases or third-party SaaS applications

what is sli ,sla and slo

SLI (Service Level Indicator):

A metric that measures the performance or reliability of a service (e.g., uptime, response time).
SLA (Service Level Agreement):

A contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the expected level of service, often with penalties if not met (e.g., 99.9% uptime guarantee).
SLO (Service Level Objective):

A goal set for a specific SLI, defining the acceptable performance (e.g., 99.9% uptime is the SLO for an uptime SLI).

in statement of puprose application we define sli 
Monitor Service Metrics (SLIs):

how do we understand that at point where are we now at slo at 98 % ,97% how do we know
Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, or cloud monitoring services to track SLIs such as uptime, error rates, response times, etc.

kubelet is manager 
he is responsible for all work in node 
api-server orders anything that should be done that is done by kubelete

handle k8 security

network policy for pod 

rbac
use namespace for multi tenancy
turn on audit logging


Pause Container in Kubernetes   :———->
if u want same ip across all container how ? 
using pause container

Purpose: Acts as a lightweight placeholder for the network namespace of a Pod, allowing containers to share the same IP address.
Maintains Pod lifecycle; keeps the Pod alive even if other containers exit.   ,handled by Kubernetes.
pod does not get ip but pause container get
all containers take refrence of this container for network

tutorial first pod is created with nginx image and testbox image 
then if i do docker ps then 2 containers created  business containers  and one pause containers 
1)  pause containers restarts then pod ,pause containers , business container all restart
2) business cont deleted then only business cont deleted ,pod and pause containers remains

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/

we can determine
 ingress rule by namespace and ip and pod lables 
and egress rules same 

we can keep our database secret by adding ingrees rules in kind network policy 

for eks version to be greater than 1.27

he created 2 pods one of simple httpd and other redis 
first he go redis pod and download redis 
and second he went httptd pod by image httpd 
and in network policy yaml from pod redis and to pod matchlables
and if i tried to ping ip then u cant u can get pod ip by k get pod -o wide

network policy does work with calico , cilium ,romana,weave net, 
but not  work with flannel

network agents not installed auomatically
