we can determine
 ingress rule by namespace and ip and pod lables 
and egress rules same 

we can keep our database secret by adding ingrees rules in kind network policy 

for eks version to be greater than 1.27

he created 2 pods one of simple httpd and other redis 
first he go redis pod and download redis 
and second he went httptd pod by image httpd 
and in network policy yaml from pod redis and to pod matchlables
and if i tried to ping ip then u cant u can get pod ip by k get pod -o wide

network policy does work with calico , cilium ,romana,weave net, 
but not  work with flannel
